<div id="goals-for-this-lab" class="section level2">
<h2>Goals for this lab</h2>
<p>If you’ve never used ArcGIS, today’s lab session will take you to
familiarize yourself with it. The latest ArcGIS Pro has a very similar
interface to software of Microsoft Office. They all have
<strong>ribbon-based</strong> interfaces.</p>
<p>People’s learning curve for new software can vary from person to
person. But most people tend to feel more or less frustrated when new to
the software, and I am no exception. What I’m trying to say is that
there’s probably no quick way to learn it. All you can do is use it as
much as possible, get familiar with it, and don’t worry if you find
yourself starting slow. We’ll have a semester to do that.</p>
<p>In today’s lab session, you will 1) learn the basic functions and
windows layout (layers/panes) of ArcGIS Pro; 2) you will start to make a
map. By the end of this lab session, you should be able to</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>create folders/projects;</strong></li>
<li><strong>add data;</strong></li>
<li><strong>create a unique layer map;</strong></li>
<li><strong>put together a map layout;</strong></li>
<li><strong>use some of the primary analysis tools in Arc
Pro;</strong></li>
<li><strong>and save your project.</strong></li>
</ol>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="know-your-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Know your data</h2>
<p>Take a look at your lab data. We don’t have too many data stored
locally for our lab 1. Currently there are only six files with the same
name, which represent polling places for Tompkins County (we will be
adding more data later during this lab). Look at how the files are
listed and organized. This is normally the file format supported by
software such as ArcGIS and QGIS. This one layer of data is comprised of
a number of files: a .shp file (shape file) and other support files:
.sbn, .sbx, .shx, .prj (this one defines the projection) and .dbf (the
last one contains the attribute information).<strong>[Hint: google these
files’ suffix and get to know what they are. Google is always a good
place to start when you stack or curious!!]</strong></p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="create-a-project" class="section level2">
<h2>Create a project</h2>
<p>You will notice that you have the option of opening a recent project
or template. As we have not created a project, on the opening page,
please click on the <strong>Map</strong> option under <strong>Blank
Templates</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Create a new project</strong> dialog box opens. Give your
project a name (e.g., “Lab 1”), and navigate to your lab_1 folder.
Uncheck the <strong>‘Create a new folder for this project’</strong> box
and click OK.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="save-your-project" class="section level2">
<h2>Save your project</h2>
<p>Know how to save your project is a good habit to get into early.
Under the <strong>Project</strong> tab, you can save your project.
ArcGIS Pro uses *.aprx as its default project file type. Remember to
save your project along the way!!!</p>
<p>ArcGIS Pro adopts project-based workflow like other development
software. A <a
href="https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/2.8/help/projects/what-is-a-project.htm"><strong>Project</strong></a>
in ArcGIS is a set of ArcGIS geographic and database files that have
been saved in a certain organized form. It is a pointer to the locations
of the actual files – it contains no real data, only file mapping
information! You are not re-saving and changing any of the data in the
map. This means if you move your data from one place to another, your
project will lost its connection! If you were to copy the project file,
you would merely be copying the “pointers”, NOT the actual data.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is important for you, from now on, to save all relevant
data from the course folder to a (well labeled) folder you have created
on your drive or cloud. Most importantly, create and save your project
file within that same folder.</p>
<p>If you edit or change any data file (for example: changed the name of
the data in folder or moved them to other directories) related to a
exiting project, once you reopen that project, the data you change might
affect displaying the layers/data in maps. Your current project
connection to the corresponding data is invalid. You have to rebuild the
connection to restore the saved progress. See this detailed instruction
on how to <a

project items</strong></a>.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="introduction-to-the-interface" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction to the interface</h2>
<p>Above the map view is the <strong>ribbon (where magic
happens)</strong>. The ribbon has a set of core tabs: <strong>Map,
Insert, Analysis, View, Edit, Imagery, and Share</strong> that are
always present when a map view is active. Each tab has its own set of
tools, organized in groups. The <strong>Map</strong> tab has tools for
interacting with the map. For example, under the <strong>Map</strong>
tab, the <strong>Explore</strong> tool is located in the Navigate
group.</p>
<p><left><img src="figures/project_ribbon.png" width="200"></left></p>
<p>Specifically, the <strong>Explore</strong> tool allows you to move
around the map and to read information about map features of interest.
You can familiarize yourself with these tools by simply hovering over
these buttons. For example, <strong>The Full extent tool</strong> allows
you to zoom out to the full extent of your dataset, <strong>the blue
arrow</strong> below it brings you back to your previous extent.</p>
<p>Instead of using ribbon button, under the <strong>Map</strong> view,
you can also use your mouse to move around map view or gather
information such as the latitude-longitude coordinates (the mouse
pointer’s location are displayed at the bottom of the map view). You can
also use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.</p>
<p>In addition, you may see a Contents pane, a Catalog pane, or both.
Panes are additional windows that ArcGIS help you manage views and
projects. They are basically separate interfaces offer you access to
specific functionality of the software.</p>
<p>They are very important and sometimes need to be kept open all the
time. Panes in ArcGIS are very flexible, you can open, close, move, dock
and hide them based on your preferences. You can always play around them
yourself.</p>
<p><left><img src="figures/content_catalog_pane.png" width="200"></left></p>
<p>When you accidentally close them, you can go to <strong>View</strong>
-&gt; <strong>Windows</strong> and you can turn on the them again.
Noticing there are more panes to come, we will get to know them later in
our course!!</p>
<p>As you work, you’ll often open and close panes that you need for
specific tasks. You may also want to re-position panes or minimize them
to make room for maps and other views. On the ribbon, click the
<strong>View</strong> tab. In the <strong>Windows</strong> group, click
<strong>Reset Panes</strong> and click <strong>Reset Panes for Mapping
(Default)</strong>. And voilà, they will be back to default look.</p>
<p>The two panes can be docked on either sides of the ArcGIS Pro window.
They can also stacked on top of the other. If the panes are stacked,
they have tabs at the bottom that allow you to switch from one pane to
the other. You can also autohide a pane by clicking the
<left><img src="figures/pin.png" width="25"></left>on the top-right
corner so it doesn’t take up space when you aren’t using it.</p>
<p>The <strong>Contents</strong> pane lists items in the active view,
such as layers in a map or layout elements in a layout. The
<strong>Catalog</strong> pane lists items that belong to the project,
such as databases, toolboxes, and folder connections. The
<strong>Catalog</strong> pane also provides access to portal items, such
as web layers.</p>

<h2>Some basic tools under Map tab</h2>
<p><br></p>
<div id="add-basemap" class="section level3">
<h3>Add basemap</h3>
<p>You noticed that a Topographic layer was automatically added when you
opened the project. If it doesn’t match your taste or is too cluttered,
you can either change or close the base map. ArcGIS Pro provides
different Basemaps in addition to the default World Topographic Map.</p>
<p>Simply go to <strong>Map</strong> tab, under <strong>Layer</strong>
group, click <strong>Basemap</strong>. In the <strong>Add
Basemap</strong> dialogue box, you have a number of options. Select one
you preferred.</p>
<p><left><img src="figures/basemap.png" width="200"></left></p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="find-location" class="section level3">
<h3>Find location</h3>
<p>ArcGIS Pro allows you to locate a place within the basemap. It
functions like a Google map. Simply under the <strong>Map</strong> tab,
go to <strong>Inquiry</strong> group, use the <strong>Locate</strong>
tool<left><img src="figures/locate.png" width="25"></left>and put in
Ithaca, NY.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="add-data" class="section level3">
<h3><strong><em>Add data</em></strong></h3>
<p>Adding data is an important step for our lab. There are two ways to
add data in ArcGIS Pro: local data and online data. The new ArcGIS Pro
is integrated with ArcGIS online, a cloud-based tool that users can
upload datasets to, which makes it more powerful. You can search and add
data that is uploaded and maintained by other users in the ArcGIS
cloud.</p>
<p>To add an ArcGIS online portal connection, complete the following
steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Click the <strong>Project</strong> tab on the ribbon and click the
<strong>Portals</strong> page. You can also access the
<strong>Portals</strong> page from the <strong>Manage Portals</strong>
link in the <strong>Sign In</strong> menu.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Add Portal</strong>. Enter the URL for the portal on
the <strong>Add Portal</strong> dialog box: <a
href="https://cugis.maps.arcgis.com"
class="uri">https://cugis.maps.arcgis.com</a> and click OK.</li>
<li>Optionally sign in to the portal. Click the
<strong>Options</strong><left><img src="figures/threedots.png" width="25"></left>
button or right-click the <strong>portal</strong> and click Sign in.
Enter your Cornell username and password.</li>
<li>You can also sign in portal using <a
href="https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/2.8/help/projects/sign-in-to-your-organization.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_1CAD4AEC94E54C1BA236F5CB2DC197D0">web
browsers</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>To make the new connection your active portal, right-click the URL
and click <strong>Set As Active Portal</strong>. Now, you are ready to
add data online. Back in the map: On the <strong>Map tab-Layer
group</strong>, click <strong>Add Data</strong> and click
<strong>Data</strong>. In the Add Data dialog box, select <strong>ArcGIS
Online</strong>.</p>
<p>Now let’s add a few data from <strong>ArcGIS Online</strong>. In the
search ArcGIS Online box, lets search for</p>
<ul>
<li>Tompkins County parcel (Tompkins county tax parcels);</li>
<li>TCBuildings (Tompkins county Building footprints);</li>
<li>TcStreets (Tompkins county streets);</li>
<li>TCMunis (Tompkins county municipal boundaries).</li>
</ul>
<p>The search allows for fuzzy matching, the name might not be exactly
the same, but choose the one with the latest date. Also pay attention to
the owner, data is more credible if it is provided by government
agency.</p>
<p>Now, let’s add the data from your <em>local drive</em>. Navigate to
your drive under <strong>Project/Folders</strong> and add the data from
your Lab_1 folder for - polling_places13 - polling locations</p>

<div id="layers-display-on-the-contents-pane" class="section level3">
<h3>Layers display on the <strong>Contents pane</strong></h3>
<p><br></p>
<div id="change-display-order" class="section level4">
<h4>change display order</h4>
<p>Note that the <strong>Contents pane</strong> includes several options
of displaying layers: List by <strong>Drawing Order or Source</strong>
etc. You are able to turn the various “layers” on and off, as well as
rearrange the order in which they are presented by “clicking” and
“dragging” the layers. When you drag layers, a black line appears just
above the layer you are about to move. Move this line until you reach
the new position for the layer and let go of the mouse button to drop
the layer there.</p>
<p><em>Now let’s rearrange the order of layers from the top to the
bottom as polling_places13, TcStreets, TCBuildings, Parcels, and
TCMunis.</em></p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="rename-layers" class="section level4">
<h4>rename layers</h4>
<p>The current names are not particularly helpful. Let’s change layer
name so they are understandable (note: sometimes you may have to open
the attribute table and look for clues to determine what a more
appropriate title should be).</p>
<ul>
<li>First, give our Map a name. In the Contents pane, right click on the
Map and go to Map properties. Under the General tab, change the name to
‘Ithaca’. Click OK. (Or simply left click it.)</li>
<li>Right click on “TcStreets” layer and select
<strong>Properties</strong>. In the Layer <strong>Properties</strong>
dialog box, select the <strong>General</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Name</strong> type “Tompkins County Roads” and hit
OK.</li>
<li>Change so the others read as follows (or whatever you like):
<ul>
<li>TCBuildings: Building footprints</li>
<li>TCMunis: Municipal boundaries</li>
<li>polling_places13: Polling locations</li>
<li>TcStreets: Tompkins County roads</li>
<li>taxparcelsrps: Tompkins County Tax Parcels</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that you are not really changing the name of the original
layer files, only the name displayed in ArcGIS Pro.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="the-attribute-table" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>The attribute table</strong></h3>
<p>By right clicking on our tax parchel layer in the
<strong>Contents</strong> pane, you can access the attribute table
(check other functions/shortcuts under the right clicking drop-down
menu). A table view opens with the parcels layer attributes, which will
contain the attribute information about this layer.</p>
<p>The attribute table is a spread sheet file in which rows represent
observations/cases and columns represent variables/attributes. Or to put
it differently, the rows correspond to features (in this case polygons
that correspond to parcels) and the columns correspond to the attributes
of these spatial features. There is a one-to-one link between the
features in the map and the rows in the table. This allows users to
retrieve attribute information about any feature in the map. It also
allows users to display one or more attributes for each geographic
feature and easily create maps of particular attributes.</p>
<p>The first column in the attribute table (FID) is a Feature ID, which
assigns a unique number to each feature, starting from zero. The FID is
assigned automatically by the GIS system and cannot be changed.</p>
<p>The last column in the attribute table shows the type of feature (in
this case polygons). Any given shapefile can only hold one type of
feature (i.e. points, lines or polygons) and cannot combine different
feature types.</p>
<p>The other columns all contain various attribute information. Some of
these are recognizable, while others are probably not, and will require
an examination of the metadata to determine what they represent.</p>
<p>Now, let’s do some statistics.</p>
<p>Right click on the <strong>“Calcacres”</strong> column heading and go
to <strong>Statistics.</strong> This will display a basic frequency
distribution of parcel size. The output is not particularly helpful. Now
let’s go back and right click on the layer of tax parcels and go to drop
down menu of <strong>Create Chart/Create Bar chart</strong>. Under the
<strong>properties</strong>, select <strong>PROPCLASS</strong> as the
<strong>Category or Date</strong>, <strong>SUM</strong> as the
<strong>Aggregation</strong>, and <strong>ACRES</strong> as the
<strong>Numeric fields</strong>. Click “Apply.” This produces a more
useful chart of acreage according to the property class. We could then
export this chart as an image file using the <strong>Export</strong>
button.</p>

<p>Turn off all layer except for Municipal boundaries. Right click on
Municipal boundaries layer and take a look at the attribute table. Note
that while each municipality has a Name, these are often duplicate and
contingent on the <strong>‘MUNITYPE’</strong> (City of Ithaca, Town of
Ithaca, etc.). The attribute <strong>‘FULLNAME’</strong> will give us a
unique name for each polygon.</p>
<p>Close the table, right click again and click on
<strong>Symbology</strong> which will open the
<strong>Symbology</strong> panel. Let’s create a ‘unique values’ map
using the attribute <strong>‘FULLNAME’</strong>. Under <strong>Primary
symbology</strong>, go to unique values. For <strong>Field 1</strong>
choose <strong>‘FULLNAME’</strong>, then click the <strong>add all
values
button</strong><left><img src="figures/adddata.png" width="20"></left>.
ArcGIS assigns colors according to the <strong>Color scheme</strong>
that is currently selected. If you click on the down arrow for
<strong>Color scheme</strong>, you will find many other choices. Select
one of your choices.</p>
<p>If you want to edit a particular feature (for example a particular
polygon), you can double-click on it. For example, you can double click
on ‘City of Ithaca’ and change its color (Note that the symbol selector
also includes pattern symbols in addition to solid colors).</p>

</div>
<div id="adjusting-symbology" class="section level4">
<h4>Adjusting Symbology</h4>
<p>Let’s adjusting the symbology of other features. Right click on the
Polling Locations, and select <strong>Symbology</strong>. Change the
points to stars (note that you can adjust the color and size as
well).</p>
<p><left><img src="figures/polling_symbology.png" width="250"></left></p>
<p>You will note that several of the layers from ArcGIS online were
added with their symbology already classified. For example, streets are
already classified according to the Maintenance variable, and Buildings
are categorized according to type (BTYPE).</p>
<p>Right click on the Parcels layer and go to symbology. In the
symbology dialog box, select ‘unique values’ as the primary symbology,
‘PROPCLASS’ as the field. We now have created a unique value map of
parcels categorized according to property type.</p>

<h4>Creating Labels</h4>
<p>Close the <strong>Symbology</strong> pane. Again, right click on the
municipalities layer in the Contents and go to the

class pane, notice the default attribute (‘Name’) under the
<strong>Expression box</strong>. Delete this and identify
<strong>‘FULLNAME’</strong> as the appropriate field (this will specify
to Arc which attributes to use for the labels). Note that within this
dialog box you can adjust the label style and placement properties of
the labels. Click Apply. Back in the contents pane, right click on the
municipalities layer, and click <strong>Label</strong> – the name of
each municipality will now appear in the map.</p>

<div id="mapping-layouts" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Mapping layouts</strong></h3>
<p>Now we will come to the final steps of mapping. We will now create a
map layout. For this layout, we will include a zoomed view of downtown
Ithaca that displays streets, parcels, and polling locations with a
context map of Tompkins County that has all the municipal boundaries
labeled with municipal names included.</p>
<p><strong>Most importantly, these are the basic elements you should
include to your map layout every time you create a map!!!</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Title (and sub-titles if necessary)</li>
<li>Legend (Is it legible? Does it make sense? Are the titles coherent?
Do the number breaks make sense?)</li>
<li>Metadata/notes (tell us about the map! Who created it? Where? Date?
What is the data source? Projection? Units? How is the data classified?
What is the purpose of the map?)</li>
<li>Scale bar (Do units (feet, miles), breaks (not too many!) make
sense?)</li>
<li>A north arrow</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, let’s get our “hands dirty”.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="creating-a-layout." class="section level4">
<h4>Creating a layout.</h4>
<p>The first step in making a page layout is to insert a blank layout.
On the ribbon, click the <strong>Insert</strong> tab. In the
<strong>Project</strong> group, click New Layout to show page size and
orientation options. Under <strong>ANSI - Portrait</strong>, click
<strong>Letter</strong> (this is a matter of preference). A new, blank
layout view opens.</p>
<p><left><img src="figures/letterlayout.png" width="250"></left></p>
<p>Let’s give the layout a name. In the Contents pane of <strong>layout
view</strong>, right-click <strong>Layout</strong> and click
<strong>Properties.</strong> On the Layout Properties dialog box, change
the name from Layout to ‘Ithaca’.</p>
<p>Now let us create a map frame in our layout. Under the
<strong>Insert</strong> tab, click the <strong>Map Frame</strong>
drop-down arrow. Select the frame with your data (usually not the first
one, the first one is the default). Use your mouse to draw a large
rectangle on the layout page. The map frame is added to the layout. It
is currently selected, as indicated by selection handles. This will
allow us to move it around the page to position it correctly.</p>
<p><left><img src="figures/insertmap.png" width="250"></left></p>
<p>Right click inside the frame and select <strong>Activate</strong>
(this can also be accessed through the Layout Tab at the top as well).
This will allow you to manipulate the map data within the layout frame
and select the correct size and position for your data.</p>
<p><left><img src="figures/activate.png" width="250"></left></p>
<p>In the Contents pane, right-click Map Frame and click
<strong>Properties</strong>. In the Map Frame
<strong>Properties</strong> dialog box, click the
<strong>General</strong> tab if necessary. Change the name to ‘Ithaca’.
Notice at the top, we can toggle between the <strong>layout view and the
map view</strong>:</p>
<p>In the layout view, Zoom in to the downtown area by using mouse wheel
(remember you have to have the map frame activated. The symbology of the
polling places should be red stars. The symbology of the streets should
be a single symbol. The symbology of the parcels should be categorized
according to property class.(What we have done before)</p>
<p>To close an activation session to avoid unintended changes, go to
<strong>Activated Map Frame Layout tab</strong>, click on the
<strong>close
activation</strong><left><img src="figures/closebutton.png" width="40"></left>
at the top left.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="add-a-second-map-frame-context-map" class="section level4">
<h4>Add a second map frame (context map)</h4>
<p>Let’s create a context map. Under the <strong>insert</strong> tab,
add a new map. Note that insert a map, not a layout frame!!! In the
<strong>Contents pane</strong>, under Drawing Order, right-click
<strong>Map</strong> and click <strong>Properties</strong>. In the Map
<strong>Properties</strong> dialog box, click the
<strong>General</strong> tab if necessary. Change the name to ‘Tompkins
County’.</p>
<p><left><img src="figures/newmap.png" width="450"></left></p>
<p>This time, add only the Municipal boundaries layer to this map frame.
You can do it like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to Ithaca map, right click on the Municipal boundaries layer</li>
<li>Select “Copy”</li>
<li>Go to Tompkins map, right click and select paste</li>
</ul>
<p><left><img src="figures/secondmap.png" width="450"></left></p>
<p>Re-title the layer and create labels for their full names (feel free
to experiment with placement and stylistic considerations).</p>
<p>Now, add a second “Map Frame” to your Ithaca layout to display the
Tompkins County map (To do this, you need to de-activate your previous
layout session, follow the steps we showed in the previous part,
<em>think through it yourself</em>.)</p>
<p><left><img src="figures/secondmapframe.png" width="450"></left></p>
<p>Within the <strong>contents pane</strong> of layout view, rename this
second Map frame ‘Tompkins County’.</p>
<p>Adding data frames is useful if you wish to include overview/context
maps, or to display maps of different variables in the same layout
(e.g. for a poster presentation). You can individually adjust each of
the map frames on the page. To do that remember to <strong>activate and
de-activate</strong> different map frames.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="add-map-extent-indicator" class="section level4">
<h4>Add map extent indicator</h4>
<p>Let us include a extent indicator to indicate the relationship
between the two map frames.</p>
<p>On the <strong>Insert</strong> tab click the <strong>Extent
Indicator</strong> drop-down arrow and click Ithaca. In this case, you
must first click the Map Frame of Tompkins County in order to choose
Ithaca in the Extent Indicator. (You must be clear what kind of
relationship you want to indicate among these maps! In this case, the
relation is containing.)</p>
<p>Open (right click) the <strong>properties</strong> for <strong>the
Extent of Ithaca</strong> and the <strong>Format Extent Indicator
pane</strong> appears.</p>
<p><left><img src="figures/extendind.png" width="300"></left></p>
<p>In the Format Extent Indicator pane, you can select an appropriate
symbol for the extent map. Under <strong>Extent Indicator</strong>,
check the <strong>Apply Symbol outside extent tab</strong>, and for
<strong>Leader</strong> style select “<strong>Line to center</strong>”.
You will find a line linking between the source map frame and the extent
indicator.</p>
<p><left><img src="figures/extendconnect.png" width="300"></left></p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="add-map-layout-elements" class="section level4">
<h4>Add map layout elements</h4>
<p>You’ll add a legend, north arrow, and scale bar to the layout. The
legend explains the map’s symbology. The north arrow and scale bar
provide geographic context. Legends: Note: Before inserting a legend,
spaces and any extraneous or unnecessary symbols or icons should be
removed. You will also want to take this opportunity to delete
unnecessary elements (for example, parcels contain a field for ’All
other values”, which is not particularly useful in a legend. Open the
symbology for the parcels layer, and adjust (i.e., delete) both the
symbology and the text for this category. The legend should include the
property classes, streets, and polling places</p>
<p>General notes on Legends: The legends below are for a map of
household median income based on census data. Think about all the ways
in which the legend on the left, which is what you get by accepting the
ArcGIS defaults, is hard to understand. The bottom line: DO not create a
map with a legend that looks like the one on the left!</p>
<p>Under the Insert tab, click Legend . To work with the properties of
the legend as a whole, right-click the Legend heading in the Contents
pane and click Properties. Alternatively, right-click the selected
legend on the layout). We are interested in displaying a legend for the
‘Ithaca’ map frame (not Tompkins County). Try cleaning up the legend so
that only the most important information is showing.</p>
<p>Note: If you fail to clean the legend, you can convert the legend to
a graphic and manipulate the legend independently. you should only use
this function if the tools in legend properties window are not
sufficient. Once you convert your legend to a graphic it is no longer
connected to the data, which means the legend will no longer reflect
changes you make on your map, e.g., it will not add new layers or
reflect changes in colors.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Move the legend off the map.</li>
<li>Right Click on the legend and choose Convert to Graphics.</li>
<li>Right Click on the legend and choose Ungroup. You now can move and
edit all of the elements of the legend independently.</li>
<li>When you are done with your edits, click the mouse and drag a
rectangle over all of the elements of your legend to highlight all of
them. Right click and choose Group.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can add background colors to your data frame – right click on the
data frame within the table of contents and go to Properties/Frame –
select a background or border of your choice</p>
<p>Scale Bars: A word on scale bars:</p>
<p>• The first scale bar above is what ArcGIS gave as the default after
we inserted a scale and did nothing else. It shows quite arbitrary
numbers, e.g., 2,350 and 4,700, which are not acceptable.<br />
• The second scale bar reflects the fact that we specified that the
distance units be in miles, because for distances over a mile, it is
easier to understand miles than feet (same with meters and kilometers).
But again, the numbers are quite arbitrary. • The last scale bar is in
miles AND it is easy to read and to use as a measure on the map because
it uses whole numbers and has easily understandable divisions of whole
numbers (0.25, 0.5, 0.75). This was done easily by simply stretching out
the scale bar manually until it said 2 miles (alternatively we could
have compressed it to 1 mile)</p>
<p>The bottom line is – NEVER simply accept the default if it is not
easy to read and to use! Take control over your scale bar! Now insert a
scale bar: There are many options. I chose the simplest, but feel free
to find one that works for you. Place the scale bar, notice that the
default may not be the most intuitive! We can grab the end and extend
the scale bar so that it includes more obvious break points.</p>
<p>Still a bit cluttered for my taste (0.13 miles is not an intuitive
distance!) In the format scale bar pane, reduce the number of divisions
from 2 to 1. Also note that we can adjust the map units as well as the
map frame (Tompkins County is merely the context, so no need to create a
scale bar). The downtown Ithaca map frame is important one here. For the
downtown Ithaca map, feet may be appropriate. For the Tompkins County
data frame, miles may be appropriate. Much better in my opinion!</p>
<p>6.5 Insert text Next, you’ll add a map title and some descriptive
text. On the Insert tab, in the Graphics and Text group, click the
Rectangle text tool . On the layout, above the map frame, draw a
rectangle for your map title. When you release the mouse button, the
word Text appears inside an outline of the box. The text is highlighted
so you can start to edit it. In the Format text panel, edit the font
size, style and color (Under text symbol/properties) Alternatively, On
the ribbon, under Text, click the Format tab. Adjust the font, style and
size appropriately.</p>
<p>Change Text Format under Ribbon</p>
<p>Editing Text Format Under text symbol/properties Add an appropriate
title (short, concise, direct) and sub-title (if necessary). When you’re
finished, click an empty area on the layout. The text element is now
selected on the layout. It also typical to include a text box with name,
date, data source and projection information, as well as other pertinent
information. For now, name and date are fine.</p>
<p>Insert a north arrow (personally I prefer one with clean, modern
lines, but that’s just me!), size and place on layout accordingly.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="export-the-layout" class="section level4">
<h4>Export the layout</h4>
<p>Now that your layout is finished, you can print it or export it to a
file that can be easily shared. On the ribbon, click the Share tab. In
the Export group, click Layout . The Export Layout pane appears. On the
Properties tab, change File Type to PNG, JPEG or TIFF necessary. In the
Name box type Lab 1 or something similar. Click Browse and browse to the
location where you want to save the file. At the bottom of the pane,
click Export. When the export is completed, click View exported file at
the bottom of the pane. The file opens in your default image viewing
application. If you want to print the layout, on the Share tab, in the
Print group, click Layout . You may need to change some printer
settings, such as the page orientation, before you send the layout to
the printer.</p>

<div id="part-two-critiquing-a-map-40-pts" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Part Two: Critiquing a Map</strong> (40 pts)</h4>
<p>Maps are all around us, and they can be a great source of
inspiration. However, they can also be misleading (as Monmonier argues
in his 1991 classic <strong><a
href="https://lecturasurbanas.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/monmonier_how-to-lie-with-maps.pdf">How
to Lie with Maps</a></strong> )</p>
<p>Find a map and critique it, post a copy of your answers on Canvas
Discussion. To assess the effectiveness of the map, answering the
following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you like the map? Why or why not?</li>
<li>Is the map misleading in anyway? Does it exaggerate the key
point?</li>
<li>Is there extra information that distracts your attention from the
data or makes the map “look better”?</li>
<li>What visualization techniques from this map would you like to use in
your own maps? What would you change?</li>
</ul>
